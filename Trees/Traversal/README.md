# Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order and Spiral Order)

Traversal is a process to visit all the nodes of a tree and may print their values too. Because, all nodes are connected via edges (links) 
we always start from the root (head) node. That is, we cannot randomly access a node in a tree. Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked 
List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways. Following are the 
generally used ways for traversing trees.

## Depth First Traversals:

- Inorder (Left, Root, Right) 
- Preorder (Root, Left, Right) 
- Postorder (Left, Right, Root) 

## Breadth First Traversals:

- Level Order (Left to right in each row)
- Spiral Order (Alternate direction in alternate rows)
